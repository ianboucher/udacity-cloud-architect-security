# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

- Move web app servers to the private subnet

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

 - No. 
 - A VPC endpoint would provide a method for resources within the VPC to securely access the S3 bucket, without leaving the Amazon network 
 - However, if the bucket permissions are still public/insecure it would still be possible to access the bucket from the public internet

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

- No, existing objects are not affected by applying default encryption.
- In order to encrypt existing objects it would be necessary to re-upload them or copy the object over itself

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

- If the original CloudFormation template were applied to the stack in this environment, it would overwrite changes made via the CLI or console
- A CloudFormation template is declaritive & therefore describes the final configuration of a stack.
