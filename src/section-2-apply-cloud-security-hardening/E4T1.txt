# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

Authentication:
- The recommended "gold standard" is to make EC2 instances immutable - i.e. remove ALL ability to login the instances, thus removing the ability to obtain access by brute-force.
- A second option is to only allow authentication via a configuration management tool, such as AWS Systems manager, along with an instance profile role that allows the instance to work with SSM
- In conjunction with access via Systems Manager, role based access should be utilised - employing a role which only provides users with that role permission to login to only the specific instance in question.

Ingress Control:
- Tighten security groups to prevent access from the internet
- Move web-app instances into private subnet

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the event that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

- Allow only role-based access to S3 buckets and require instances to assume the correct role, ensuring that the secret bucket required a different role from the free recipes
- Enable SSE on the buckets
- Encrypt data via client-side encryption before writing to the bucket
