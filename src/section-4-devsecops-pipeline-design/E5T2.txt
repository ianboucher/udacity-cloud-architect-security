# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

 - Regula - scans Terraform templates
 - Cloudsploit - scans CloudFormation templates

### Example vulnerability

 - May identify an overly permissive resource policy, e.g. wildcard resource vs specific bucket name for S3

## Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

 - Clair - parses container image contents and reports on vulnerabilities affecting those contents, based on CVE database

### Example vulnerability

- May identify exploits affecting libaries or sofware baked into the container image e.g. an exploit affecting particular versions of CentOS or Alpine Linux

## Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

- AWS Config
- AWS Inspector

### Example vulnerability

- Unencrypted volumes/buckets, misconfigured ALB HTTPS redirection etc.
- Root access to EC2 instances
