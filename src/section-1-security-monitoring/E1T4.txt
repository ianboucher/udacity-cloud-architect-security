Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1

Web application servers are deployed in a public subnet, within an overly permissive security group.
They are therefore open to the public internet, placing them at greater risk of attack.

# Poor practice 2

S3 buckets are deployed with public access and without server-side encryption.
This enables them to be accessed from the public internet and the contents can be read in plain text.

# Other poor practices

- Keypair/SSH used for webserver EC2 access, rather than specific roles or treating them as immuatable.
- S3 policy docs too permissive, containing wildcards for resources, enabling web servers to access any bucket.
- Web security group too open, allowing all traffic from any port for different methods of connection.
- ALB does not accept/redirect to HTTPS
