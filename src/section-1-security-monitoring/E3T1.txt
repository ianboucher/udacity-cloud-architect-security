# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

- No findings visible in GuardDuty
- Despite running the attack simulation for over an hour each time, on serveral attempts, no findings appeared in GuardDuty.
- After waiting 24hrs to see if findings appeared, I tried disabling/reenabling GuardDuty and re-running the simulation again - still no findings
- EC2 monitoring and VPC Flow Logs appeared to show the attack
- GuardDuty itself appeared to be working to some extent as it picked up console logins with my root account

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

- GuardDuty documentation lists the following data sources
  - CloudTrail Event Logs 
  - CloudTrail Management Events
  - CloudTrail S3 Data Events
  - VPC Flow Logs
  - DNS Logs

Of these data sources, VPC Flow Logs would be the source that would enable GuardDuty to detect
a brute force attack as the Flow Logs record IP traffic to/from EC2 network interfaces within a given VPC
